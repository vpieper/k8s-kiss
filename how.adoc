So we covered what Kubernetes offers us, but how does it actually achieve this?

This looks daunting. Let's give a small explanation of these components.

#### kube-apiserver

You'll be interacting with the api server almost 90% of the time. Your interactions with the command line tool will call the api server, which will further handle your requests.

#### etcd

Some of you may have heard about this. etcd is a simple key value store, excelling at being reliable at scale. This is a fully fledged product. You can find more info about etcd here: https://etcd.io/

etcd is used as storage for all cluster information.


#### kube-scheduler

This component puts pods onto nodes.

#### kube-controller-manager

This is a composition of multiple dedicated controllers. These controllers have several tasks:

* Node Controller: Manages lifecycle of nodes
* Replication Controller: Manages the demand of replication within the cluster.
* Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints, which effectively links services to their assigned pods.
* Service Account and Token Controllers: Manages accounts and namespaces. 
* Cloud Controller: Integration with cloud providers. This allows you to use cloud services as part of Kubernetes.

It may be worth mentioning that Kubernetes is quite extendable. It allows for custom controllers, as well. A sample can be found here: https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller


#### cloud-controller-manager

This part of the control plane is optional. As you can imagine, with our local installation we do not have a cloud controller. These are to integrate the `cloud-controller-manager`, `kube-api-server` and the individual `kubelet` with the cloud provider for several concerns, such as load balancing and storage.
