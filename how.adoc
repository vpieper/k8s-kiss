So we covered what Kubernetes offers us, but how does it actually achieve this?

This looks daunting. Let's give a small explanation of these components.

#### kube-apiserver

You'll be interacting with the api server almost 90% of the time. Your interactions with the command line tool will call the api server, which will further handle your requests.

#### etcd

Some of you may have heard about this. etcd is a simple key value store, excelling at being reliable at scale. This is a fully fledged product. You can find more info about etcd here: https://etcd.io/

etcd is used as storage for all cluster information.


#### kube-scheduler

This component puts pods onto nodes.

#### kube-controller-manager

This is a composition of multiple dedicated controllers. These controllers have several tasks:

* Node Controller: Manages lifecycle of nodes
* Replication Controller: Manages the demand of replication within the cluster.
* Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints, which effectively links services to their assigned pods.
* Service Account and Token Controllers: Manages accounts and namespaces. 

It may be worth mentioning that Kubernetes is quite extendable. It allows for custom controllers, as well. A sample can be found here: https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller
